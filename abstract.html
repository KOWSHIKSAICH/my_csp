        <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This survey aims to gather comprehensive insights into people's preferences and experiences with mobile networks, focusing on key aspects such as signal quality, recharge plans, recharge periods, and daily data usage. By targeting a diverse group of mobile phone users in USMANSAHEBPET, SPSR Nellore District, the study seeks to identify which mobile network service providers are favored and why. It examines the relationships between signal strength, recharge behaviors, and data usage to uncover trends and potential areas for service improvement. Participants will rate signal strength in various locations and times, provide details on their recharge plans (prepaid or postpaid), frequency, costs, and factors influencing their choices. The survey will also collect data on daily usage, including the amount of data consumed and its purposes. By analyzing this data, the study aims to identify trends, common issues, and provide recommendations to service providers to enhance their offerings, better meeting the needs and preferences of users.</section>
